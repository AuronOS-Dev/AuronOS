**AuronOS** is an experimental operating system written in **C#** using the **Cosmos** framework. It is built for customization, minimalism, and support, as it *will* contain features like full file support, and beautiful UI.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Currently, AuronOS is in early-development, and is not yet stable for release. Currently, we have a shell for the OS, but that is it. We do not recommend installation yet, due to this lack of features.
